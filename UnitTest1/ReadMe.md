# Overview
This is the implementation of the facade design pattern in the example of an e-commerse app. All the complexities of placing the order must be hidden from the client, they inturn get a simple method to call for placing the order.
The complexity of placing maintaining the inventory is also hidden from the staff, they get a method to update the inventory.

# Description
This is the ecommerse app where client can place an order and the staff can update the inventory if they have the access password. I have implemented it using the facade design pattern.
